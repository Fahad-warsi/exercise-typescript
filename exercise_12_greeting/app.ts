// 12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name,
// print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

//assign value
let names: string[] = ["Hameed", "Fahad", "Amin", "Ahmed"];
//print each value with greeting.
for (let i of names) {
  console.log("Hi Mr.", i);
}
